# treasure map - You are going to write a program that will mark a spot with an X.
# In the starting code, you will find a variable called map.
# This map contains a nested list. When map is printed this is what the nested list looks like:
# [['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']]
# This is a bit hard to work with. So on lines 6 and 23, we've used this line of code print(f"{row1}\n{row2}\n{row3}" to format the 3 lists to be printed as a 3 by 3 square, each on a new line. 

row1 = ["⬜️","️⬜️","️⬜️"]
row2 = ["⬜️","⬜️","️⬜️"]
row3 = ["⬜️️","⬜️️","⬜️️"]
map = [row1, row2, row3]
print(f"{row1}\n{row2}\n{row3}")
position = input("Where do you want to put the treasure? ")


col = int(position[0])
row = int(position[1])

map[row-1][col-1] = "x"

print(f"{row1}\n{row2}\n{row3}")
